        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering
        skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and
        honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from
        indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a
        value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but
        to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
        the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass
        new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal education takes place in
            education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically
            guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into
            educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
            alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible
            manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal
            education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels,
            or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the
            highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.[2] For instance,
            homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure. </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists belonging to diverse fields.[3][4][5] Many agree that
        education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.[6] But
        they often include other aims as well, such as fostering skills and character traits.[6][3][7] However, there are deep
        disagreements about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some conceptions,
        it is primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.[8][9][4] Others understand
        it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process. On this view, education is what
        educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of them.[8][9][4] However, the
        term may also refer to the academic study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and learning, as
        well as the social institutions involved in these processes.[9] Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the
        Latin word ēducātiō ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ēducō ("I educate, I train") which is related to the
        homonym ēdūcō</p>
